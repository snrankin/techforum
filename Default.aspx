	<h1>Join Us at TechForum</h1>
<h2>March 26-&ndash;28th 2014</h2>
<h4>Find out what's happening in the technology industry!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.uat.edu" target="_blank">University of Advancing Technology</a> will be hosting the 2014 Spring Tech Forum on campus in Tempe, Arizona, from March 26&ndash;28, 2014. 
This event brings industry speakers on campus for lectures, panels and ample opportunities to network. It's a great way to get an insiders' view in game development, digital video, network security, human computer interaction and much more!</p>
<p>This year's guest speakers come from a wide variety of backgrounds that explore pathways as varied as working at an independent game studio to working at Blizzard. From user experience design in music to how design itself can change our world. And from practical technology in current day Hollywood, to techniques for an Indie-Sci Fi film. Our presenters bring a diverse amount of experience and knowledge to Tech Forum and we can't wait to hear from them.</p>
<p>Tech Forum also offers a variety of activities outside of the speaker series, including a career fair, portfolio reviews, tech expo and annual alumni panel. There are lots of ways to get involved! Check out the <a href="Schedule.aspx">schedule</a> and <a href="Speakers.aspx">presenter bios</a> for a more complete listing of what to expect during Tech Forum this year.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Forum is a free event</strong> that is open to the community; we hope you can join us!</p>
